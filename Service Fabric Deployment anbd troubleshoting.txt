The most common explanation for code the runs locally but not in Azure is that you're targeting a .NET framework version that is not present on the VMs provisioned in a Service Fabric cluster. They currently provide .NET 4.5.1 out of the box, with .NET 4.5.2 getting added some time this month. Try retargeting your app to 4.5.1.

Update: as of February 2016, VMs provisioned for Service Fabric clusters come with .NET 4.5.2 by default.
